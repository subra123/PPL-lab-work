Got it! Hereâ€™s the **Rust question with code** for each problem:

## **1. Library Book Management System (Ownership & Move Semantics)**  

### **Question:**  
Develop a **Library Book Management System** in Rust where books can be added, issued, and returned. Implement the following:  

- Define a `Book` struct with fields: `title`, `author`, `ISBN`, and `is_issued` (boolean).  
- Implement an `issue_book` function that moves ownership of a book from the library to a borrower.  
- Demonstrate ownership transfer by preventing access to the book once it is issued.  
- Use `.clone()` to allow the library to maintain a backup of issued books.  

### **Rust Code:**  
```rust
struct Book {
    title: String,
    author: String,
    ISBN: String,
    is_issued: bool,
}

impl Book {
    fn new(title: &str, author: &str, ISBN: &str) -> Self {
        Self {
            title: title.to_string(),
            author: author.to_string(),
            ISBN: ISBN.to_string(),
            is_issued: false,
        }
    }

    fn issue_book(self) -> Self {
        println!("Issuing the book: {}", self.title);
        Self {
            is_issued: true,
            ..self
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let book = Book::new("The Rust Book", "John Doe", "123-456-789");
    let library_backup = book.clone();

    println!("Library backup (before issue):");
    println!("Title: {}, Author: {}, ISBN: {}, Issued: {}", 
        library_backup.title, library_backup.author, library_backup.ISBN, library_backup.is_issued);

    let issued_book = book.issue_book();
    
    println!("\nIssued book details:");
    println!("Title: {}, Author: {}, ISBN: {}, Issued: {}", 
        issued_book.title, issued_book.author, issued_book.ISBN, issued_book.is_issued);
}
```

## **2. Secure Banking System (Borrowing & Mutable References)**  

### **Question:**  
Design a **secure banking system** where multiple users can check their balance, but only one user can modify it at a time.  

- Define a `BankAccount` struct with fields: `account_number`, `owner_name`, and `balance`.  
- Implement `view_balance()` to allow multiple users to borrow (immutable reference) the balance.  
- Implement `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions that modify the balance using **mutable borrowing**.  
- Ensure only one function modifies the balance at a time.  

### **Rust Code:**  
```rust
struct BankAccount {
    account_number: u32,
    owner_name: String,
    balance: f64,
}

impl BankAccount {
    fn new(account_number: u32, owner_name: &str, balance: f64) -> Self {
        Self {
            account_number,
            owner_name: owner_name.to_string(),
            balance,
        }
    }

    fn view_balance(&self) {
        println!("Balance for {}: ${:.2}", self.owner_name, self.balance);
    }

    fn deposit(&mut self, amount: f64) {
        self.balance += amount;
        println!("Deposited ${:.2}. New balance: ${:.2}", amount, self.balance);
    }

    fn withdraw(&mut self, amount: f64) {
        if self.balance >= amount {
            self.balance -= amount;
            println!("Withdrew ${:.2}. New balance: ${:.2}", amount, self.balance);
        } else {
            println!("Insufficient balance!");
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut account = BankAccount::new(1001, "Alice", 500.0);
    
    account.view_balance();
    
    account.deposit(200.0);
    account.view_balance();
    
    account.withdraw(150.0);
    account.view_balance();
}
```

## **3. Text Processing Tool (String Slices)**  

### **Question:**  
Build a **text-processing tool** that extracts useful information from user input.  

- Allow users to input a sentence.  
- Extract a specific word using **string slicing** (e.g., extract `"Rust"` from `"Rust is fast and safe."`).  
- Use a function that takes a string slice as input and returns the extracted slice.  
- Modify the original string and ensure the extracted word remains valid.  

### **Rust Code:**  
```rust
fn extract_first_word(sentence: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes = sentence.as_bytes();
    
    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &sentence[..i];
        }
    }
    sentence
}

fn main() {
    let sentence = "Rust is fast and safe.";
    let first_word = extract_first_word(sentence);
    
    println!("Extracted word: {}", first_word);
    
    let modified_sentence = &sentence[first_word.len()..].trim();
    println!("Modified string: {}", modified_sentence);
}
```

## **4. Weather Data Analysis (Array Slices)**  

### **Question:**  
Develop a **weather analysis tool** that processes **temperature readings** from a weather station.  

- Create an array of weekly temperature readings.  
- Extract a slice of temperatures representing the last **three days**.  
- Write a function that takes an array slice and calculates the average temperature.  
- Demonstrate an attempt to access out-of-bounds slices and handle errors safely.  

### **Rust Code:**  
```rust
fn average_temperature(temps: &[f64]) -> f64 {
    let sum: f64 = temps.iter().sum();
    sum / temps.len() as f64
}

fn main() {
    let weekly_temps = [25.6, 27.3, 26.1, 28.9, 30.2, 29.8, 31.0];
    
    let last_three_days = &weekly_temps[4..];
    
    let avg_temp = average_temperature(last_three_days);
    println!("Average temperature for the last 3 days: {:.2}Â°C", avg_temp);
}
```
